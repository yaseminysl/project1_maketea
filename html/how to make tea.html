                Run the tap a little so the water's nicely aerated, and only boil it once to keep the oxygen level up. Oxygen in water helps flavour!
            </li>
            <li>
                Pop a tea bag into your mug (<em>always</em> a big mug)
            </li>
            <li>
                Pour the hot water over the tea bag and stir briefly.
            </li>
            <li>
                Tea needs time to unlock all its flavour, so give it 3-4 minutes to do its thing. This is a perfect time to grab a sneaky cookie or daydream about vacations.
            </li>
            <li>
                Before removing the tea bag, gently squish it with a spoon against the side of the mug. Not too much or you'll make it bitter.
            </li>
            <li>
                If you want, throw in some milk or sugar or honey or nothing else at all.
            </li>
            <li>
                Enjoy!
